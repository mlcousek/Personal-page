# Personal Webpage – Jiří Mlčoušek

Welcome to the personal website of **Jiří Mlčoušek** – a passionate lifelong learner, motivator, and technology enthusiast. This site is designed to showcase my journey, achievements, and interests, and to inspire others to pursue their goals with consistency and determination.

## About the Page
This is my digital portfolio and personal hub. Here, you can find:
- A visually engaging homepage with a motivational message and direct links to my social profiles.
- Easy access to contact information for professional or personal inquiries.

## Books Site
The **Read Books** section is a curated and regularly updated list of books and study materials I have read. Each entry includes details such as the title, author, and completion date. This section reflects my commitment to continuous learning and personal growth, and may inspire visitors to explore new knowledge themselves.

## Future Plans
This website is a living project. In the near future, I plan to add more sections, including:
- Sports competitions and results
- Project showcases
- Blog posts and articles
- And much more!

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand and improve this site.
